discriminative routing mechanism (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05737)

sample temperature (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05737)

Diffuse ref2 and ref1 independently, so that $p_\theta(x_s|x_t)=\sum_{x_0}q(x_s|x_t,x_0)p_\theta(x_0|x_t)$ https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03701 can be used.

improve sample method for DataLoader

make an improvement version for continuous time (tandom? diagnal?)

Predictor-Corrector

Direct Denoising Model Supervision

Continuous Time ELBO with Factorization

partial time steps

Unet learn distribution instead of point value

migrate from argparse to ConfigArgParse

use latent diffuser

use unet from timm

use mamba

use TCN

use transformer-TCN

use transformer-encoder-decoder to predict DNA

predict from both sides to the middle

add figures to tensorboard
